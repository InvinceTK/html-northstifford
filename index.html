    </div>

    <!--Objectives-->
     <section>
       <div class = "container pt-5 border">

        <h3>Traffic:</h3>
        <span class="d-block">
          Clockhouse Lane, Guardian Avenue, Elvin Drive, Birchfield Avenue, and Harrington Crescent all have existing traffic concerns. 
          <ul>- These roads suffer from congestion, inadequate speed limit zoning, low and no curbs, inadequate traffic calming, insufficient parking, and inadequate road width.</ul>
          <ul>- A near 100% increase in traffic from residents, in addition to visitors, commercial interests (care home visitors, workers, and deliveries), and local traffic using 'new access' routes would make the area regularly impassible.</ul>
          <ul>- New access would intensify the use of existing accesses onto the B186.</ul>
        </span>

        <h3>Environment and Health</h3>
        <span class ="d-block">
          The development offers no considerable benefits to the environment, residents, or health. 
          <ul>- Removal of trees and grassed areas on this Green Belt Land, will reduce CO² absorbed.</ul>
          <ul>- A near 100% increase in estate size will increase levels of CO², CO, and refrigerants in the local air.</ul> 
          <ul>- Local air quality is already poor, with elevated levels of particulates carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide from A13, M25 & Pilgrims Lane.</ul>
          <ul>- Tree removal and a near 100% increase in estate size will lead to increases in noise pollution from local roads and intensified traffic flow.</ul>
          <ul>- The High Road already sees elevated traffic, with many of the historic buildings of note harmed by heightened traffic flow.</ul>
        </span>
        
        <h3>Wildlife</h3>
        <span class="d-block">
          Removal of Green Belt grassland land will detrimentally impact local wildlife. 

          <p></p>

          <p>Among their numbers are several protected species:</p>
          <ul>- Badgers, Adders, Slow worms, Stag beetles, Garden Tiger Moths</ul>
          The Garden Tiger Moth in particular has seen an 89% decline in the UK in recent years. It is now a protected species under the Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP).

          <p></p>

          <p>Other species that make their home here:</p>
          <ul>- Bats, Merlins, Sparrowhawks, Buzzards, Bush crickets, Glow worms, Green Woodpeckers, Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers, Breeding Fox populations</ul>
        </span>

        <h3>Local Amenities & Infrastructure</h3>
        <span class = "d-block">
          <ul>- Access to primary health care, including dentists, is currently at a premium in Grays, Chafford Hundred and Thurrock. Adding a further 97 residences and a care home will place additional strain on an already stretched resource.</ul>
          <ul>- Secondary school admission places are at a premium for residents already in North Stifford. Adding a further 97 residences places further strain on these resources.</ul>
          <ul>- Essex Police are stretched and have existing issues with Anti-social behaviour in the village. The Police are currently unable to provide high visibility patrolling and response times are not optimal.</ul>
          <ul>- Council Waste Management services are not being provided at consistent levels. For months garden waste was not collected. Bins are often collected late. Expansions in housing will place further strain on these stretched resources.</ul>
          <ul>- A large 3 story care home that is designed like the civic hall will not keep with the local area and will require a car park + commercial deliveries which will intensify existing road use.</ul>
        </span>

        <h3>Community Safety</h3>
        <span class = "d-block">
          Adding nearly 100 homes to an already densely populated area, will increase the likelihood of anti-social behaviour.
          <ul>- There are also concerns with the association of park area playgrounds and their link with crime as crime generators.</ul>
          <ul>- The SUDs drainage pond provides an area of open water, which may present safety issues for unsupervised children.</ul>
          <ul>- Placement of a care home for elderly and vulnerable persons next to Pilgrims Lane and the A13 may present serious safety considerations for disorientated residents inadvertently unsupervised.</ul>
        </span>

        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <span class = "d-block">
          A flyer was distributed to a selection of residents. Not every villager was made aware of the planning application or the intention to develop the village lands.
        </span>

        <h3>Future devopments:</h3>
        <span class = "d-block">
          There has been no clear admission as to what future developments are intended.
